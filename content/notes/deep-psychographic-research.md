# Discovering Deep Psychographic Research for High-Converting Copy

**(Avatar: Copywriters, Pain: Struggling to Connect with Audience)**

## Introduction

Note to Self: Thoughts on the "Deep-Research" Prompt from [@apollonator3000](https://x.com/apollonator3000)'s X Post.

I've been diving into this psychographic research prompt shared by [@apollonator3000](https://x.com/apollonator3000), and I'm genuinely impressed by its depth and potential. It's like a treasure map for understanding customers on a level that goes way beyond surface demographics—something I've always felt marketing should prioritize more. 

The structure is super methodical, breaking down the research into clear sections: psychographics, current solutions, forgotten attempts, and even external forces like corruption. I love how it pushes you to dig into raw, emotional data from places like Reddit, Quora, and social media comments. That's where the real gold is—people's unfiltered frustrations, hopes, and beliefs in their own words.

What really stands out to me is the focus on emotionally charged insights. The example quotes, like the one about CBD for chronic back pain, remind me how powerful it is to hear directly from the customer. It's not just about what they're using but *why* they feel the way they do about it. 

The historical angle—looking at pre-1960s solutions or buried innovations like Undecylenic Acid for foot fungus—adds a layer of intrigue that could make copy so much more compelling. I can see how weaving in a narrative about "forgotten solutions" or "Big Energy discrediting Tesla" could hook an audience emotionally, especially if they're already skeptical of mainstream solutions.

I also appreciate how the prompt ties into broader marketing trends I've been reading about, like the HubSpot piece on psychographics from 2021. It's spot-on about how understanding attitudes and interests can make campaigns more targeted. And the Forbes article on emotional marketing really drives home why this approach works—emotions drive action, whether it's outrage (like the turtle with the straw in its nose) or humor. This prompt feels like a practical way to get to those emotions systematically.

That said, I wonder about the execution. It's a lot of research—pulling from forums, reviews, and articles could be time-intensive, especially for someone new to this level of analysis. I think it'd be worth experimenting with AI tools to speed up the data collection, maybe feeding the results into something like Claude Sonnet for copywriting, as one of the replies suggested. 

Also, the prompt assumes you already know your avatar and pain point clearly. I think it'd be helpful to have a clear understanding of the avatar and pain point *before* diving into this research.

Overall, I'm excited to try this out for a project. I think it could be a game-changer for writing copy that doesn't just sell but resonates deeply. Next step: pick a niche, define my avatar and pain point, and start digging into those forums. Let's see what stories I can uncover!

## The Prompt
The prompt is structured to extract genuine insights from the market, focusing on the avatar and their pain points. Here's the prompt:

```
INPUTS:
Avatar = "ENTER_AVATAR_HERE"
Pain = "ENTER_PAIN_HERE"

## I. Psychographic Research Objective
Conduct deep research into the {avatar} who is suffering from {pain}.
The goal is to extract real, emotionally-charged insights from the market, in their own words.

We will gather data from:
- Public forums (Reddit, Quora, niche communities)
- Social media (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook comments)
- Product reviews and blog comment sections
- Articles and threads related to the problem space

---

## II. What We're Looking For

### 1. Demographic & Psychographic Insights
- Who is your customer?
- What attitudes do they have? (Religious, political, social, economic)
- What are their hopes and dreams?
- What are their biggest victories and failures?
- What outside forces do THEY believe have prevented their best life?
- What are their prejudices?
- Sum up their core beliefs about life, love, and family in 1–3 sentences.

---

### 2. Current Solutions & Market Experience
- What are they currently using to solve this problem? (List tools, techniques, products)
- What do they like about those existing solutions?
- What do they dislike or distrust about those solutions?
- Are there horror stories about the current solutions?
- Do they believe the current solution(s) work? If not, why?

Example:
> "I've taken CBD for a couple years now. I have scoliosis and chronic back pain. It definitely helps with the pain and helps me sleep at night."

---

### 3. Curiosity & Forgotten Attempts
- Has someone tried to solve this pain point in a unique way before?
- What was the result? Was it successful, a failure, or forgotten?
- Is there a conspiratorial or controversial story behind why old solutions didn't work or were buried?
- Are there pre-1960s solutions that were effective but lost to history?

Examples:
> Tesla in the energy space - discredited by Big Energy.
> WWII Army race to cure foot fungus with Undecylenic Acid - forgotten but once effective.

---

### 4. Corruption & Outside Forces
- Does the market believe this pain point didn't exist before or used to be less severe?
- Has it been recently exacerbated by outside forces?
- What are those forces (corporations, media, governments, etc.), and why does the market believe they exist?

Examples:
> Obesity and diabetes rise blamed on Dr. Ancel Keys' flawed dietary research.
> Isolated tribes without exposure to modern food don't suffer from same diseases.

---

## III. Deliverables
- Real quotes from the audience, ideally expressing emotions, frustrations, desires, or disbelief.
- Belief systems and recurring narratives that can be used in story-driven copy.
- A compiled summary of the market's worldview, skepticism, and unmet desires.
```

## Conclusion
This deep-research approach is a game-changer for anyone looking to connect more authentically with their audience. By understanding their true feelings and experiences, we can create copy that resonates on a deeper level. I highly recommend trying this method!
